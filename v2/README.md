If you want to add a new machine (e.g. server, work PC, media PC, etc), e.g. `work-laptop`, then you should create a new folder in `./hosts` that has its name suffixed with `.host` (e.g. `./host/work-laptop.host`). This folder should contain a `default.nix` file (in which **one** role from `./system/roles/` should be imported; additional tweaks may be added, but ideally the role should cover most of it; another option is creating a new more fitting role in which case additional system profiles in `./system/profiles/` might also be necessary) and a generated `hardware-configuration.nix` file. Also make sure to make the appropriate additions to `./flake.nix`.

If you want to add a new user (e.g. `guest` or `mom`), create a new profile directory for each in `./home/user.profiles` (e.g. `./home/user.profiles/mom`) which should then contain a `user@host.nix` configuration for every host you want the new user to be a part of (e.g. `./home/user.profiles/mom/mom@home-pc.nix`) as well as a `profiles` directory (e.g. `./home/user.profiles/mom/profiles`) that contains any user specifics (user installations and configurations, etc). The purpose of the `user@host.nix` configurations is mainly to enable the features in `profiles` that the user wants for that specific host. For example, you might have a gaming profile that you only want on your personal laptop whereas some more general profile(s) for things like web browsing, text processing, etc might be desired on both home and work computers.
