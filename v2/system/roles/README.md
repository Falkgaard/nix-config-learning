Every host system will have precisely *one* role.

Roles are mutually exclusive and consist of *one or more* profile(s).

Some roles may have their own exclusive profile to complement what the other profiles provide (in the case where they don't provide 100% of what is needed).

For more info on host system profiles, see `${CONFIG_ROOT}/system/profiles/README.md`.

# TODO:

* quietboot?

* systemd-boot?

* wireless?

* pipewire? (or maybe audio?)
